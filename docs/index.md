## Key Features

### Security-First Design

- üîê SSH keys with passphrase protection and keychain caching
- üéØ Service-specific AWS profiles with least-privilege IAM policies
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI for streamlined authentication
- üîÑ SSH multiplexing for efficient, reliable connections

### Developer Experience

- ‚ö° Fast model switching for Claude Code (Haiku ‚Üí Sonnet ‚Üí Opus)
- üì¶ Modern Python packaging with UV (fast) or Pixi (conda-compatible)
- üåê Multi-cloud support with consistent credential patterns
- üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive shell aliases and environment optimization

### Best Practices

- Proper credential scope isolation
- Temporary credentials where possible
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular credential rotation
- Clear permission boundaries
